# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help election officials automate the election auditing process- specifically in this case a congressional district in Colorado. Normally, this would be done in EXCEL, but that can be time consuming. By developing and running this Python script, and then verifying that the results match those from EXCEL, time can be saved on future election audits and the script can be adapted to work on other elections as well.
